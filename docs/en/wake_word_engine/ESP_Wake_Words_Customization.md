#Espressif Speech Wake-up Solution Customization Process
---

#### 1.1 Speech Wake Word Customization Process
Espressif provides users with the offline wake word customization service, which allows users to use both publicly available wake words (such as "Hi Lexin", ”Alexa”, and “Espressif”) and customized wake words.

 1. If you want to use publicly available wake words for commercial use
	- Please check the wake words provided in [esp-sr](https://github.com/espressif/esp-sr);
	- We will continue to provide more and more wake words that are free for commercial use.

 2. If you want to use custom wake words, we can also provide the offline wake word customization service.
	- If you provide a training corpus 
		- It must consist of at least 20,000 qualified corpus entries (see the section below for detailed requirements);
		- It will take two to three weeks for Espressif to train and optimize the corpus after the hardware design meets our requirement;
		- It will be delivered in a static library of wake word;
		- Espressif will charge training fees based on the scale of your production.
		
	- Otherwise
		- Espressif will collect and provide all the training corpus;
		- Espressif will deliver a static library file of successfully trained wake word to you, but won't share the corpus;
		- It will take around three weeks to collect and train the corpus;
		- Espressif will charge training fees (corpus collecting fees included) based on the scale of your production.

	- The above time is subject to change depending on the project.

	- Espressif will only charge a one-time customization fee depending on the number of wake words you customize and the scale of your production, and will not charge license fees for the quantity and time of use. Please email us at [sales@espressif.com](sales@espressif.com) for details of the fee.

		 
 3. If you want to use offline command words
 	- Please set them by yourself referring to [esp-sr](https://github.com/espressif/esp-sr/tree/c5896943ea278195968c93c8b3466c720e641ebc/speech_command_recognition) algorithm. They do not need additional customization.
 	- Similar to speech wake words, the effect of command words is also related to hardware designs, so please refer to *Espressif MIC Design Guidelines*.

#### 2.1 Requirements on Corpus

As mentioned above, you can provide your own training corpus for Espressif. Below are the requirements.

1. Audio file format
	- Sample rate: 16 kHz
	- Encoding: 16-bit signed int
	- Channel: mono
	- Format: WAV	

2. Sampling environment
	- Room with an ambient noise lower than 30 dB and reverberation less than 0.3 s, or a professional audio room (recommended).
		- Recording device: high-fidelity microphone.
			- The whole product is strongly recommended.
			- The development board of your product also works when there is no cavity structure.
		- Record in 16 kHz, and don't use **resampling**.
	- At the recording site, pay attention to the impact of reverberation interference in a closed environment.
	- Collect samples with multiple recording devices at the same time (recommended).
		- For example, postion the devices at 1 m and 3 m away.
		- So more samples are collected with the same number of time and participants.

3. Sample distribution
	- Sample size: 500. Males and females should be close to 1:1.
	- The number of children under 12 years old invloved varies from product to product, but the percentage should be no less than 15%.
	- If there are requirements for certain languages or dialects, special corpus samples need to be provided.
	- It is recommended to name the samples according to the age, gender, and quantity of the collected samples, such as HiLeXin\_male\_B\_014.wav, and ABCD represents different age groups.
